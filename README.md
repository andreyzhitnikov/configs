This repository consist of various configs. 
It started from attempt to develop in python directly on the server with low internet traffic. 
Meaning without GUI.
After some research I converged to using  vim,pdb++ and tmux. Behaviour is similar to changing perspectives in eclipse.   
For now it is two vim configs for developing in python. The light sabre version based on python mode debugger which is using rope
The jedi vim version based on jedi-vim plugin 
In addition config for pdb++ python terminal based debugger with sticky mode
